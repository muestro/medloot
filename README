## Medloot

### Description
Medloot is a project I created primarily for learning the Python programming language and gaining exposure to the Google Cloud Platform.  It accesses the Google NDB data store and is hosted on a Google App Engine instance.

The application provides limited full-text searching of data from the text-based MUD Medievia, that it has recorded both from user entered data as well as parsing of text log files.

Live demo of the application can be accessed at https://medloot.appspot.com.
